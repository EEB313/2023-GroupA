Main goals of this project:

- Observe, investigate, and demonstrate the effects of weather events such as fire, precipitation, and temperature on fungal diversity, richness, abundance.
- Evaluate the efficacy of using public data and citizen science in making analyses
- Model the effect, or lack of effect of these events on fungal diversity, and produce plausible reasons for both using existing literature.
- Use statistical tests to compare effects of weather on various species of macrofungi using the MushroomObserver database.
